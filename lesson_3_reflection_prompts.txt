When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You can work on files from a different computer.
You can share and work on projects with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on a team and not need or want to work on files placed in the repository.
A file may get changed remotely by someone else. You may not want your local version to change because you have also made changes.
